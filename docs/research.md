### Research

My main focus is on hybrid deep learning: combining models (statistical, physical, etc.) with modern deep learning architectures.

I work part time at [Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées (CMAP)](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/page-daccueil) at Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IPP).

Recent interests:

- Image denoising with joint estimation of the noise distribution
- Object tracking via modelisation of Camera tracking
- Variational Autoencoders with better MCMC
- Stochastic Transformers using SMC


### Teaching

I teach Deep Learning in various institutions (Ecole Polytechnique, Centrale-Supelec, ...) since 2015. All my teaching material (lectures, code, notebookes, videos) is available freely on this [page](https://m2dsupsdlclass.github.io/lectures-labs).
