Deep Learning has been popularized by large companies such as Google, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft, etc.
In doing so, they oriented the field towards the most meaningful applications for them:

- Sound processing (Speech-to-text for mobile phones)
- Computer Vision (Content moderation, Face recognition, etc.)
- Natural Language processing (Automatic Translation, content classification.)
- Recommender Systems (Search results, twitter/facebook feed reranking, content recommendation, etc.)

Today, most resources (teaching, code, business applications examples, etc.) are centered on these applications, occulting some of the newer.

This is however just a small part of what the Deep Learning is impacting, and can be impacting.

- Content generation (Image generation / rendering ; text generation ; voice generation)
- Deep RL (for robotics control, game playing)
- Scientific advances (protein folding, fluid simulation, quantum wave function simulations, etc.)

In this post, I'll focus on the last one and try to demonstrate why it is meaningful and promising.
