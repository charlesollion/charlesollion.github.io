I'm working on plastic pollution and biodiversity measurement using digital technologies.

I work at [Naia Science](https://www.naia-science.com/) as technical director and data scientist.

I'm still involved with my former research at [Centre de Mathématiques Appliquées (CMAP)](https://portail.polytechnique.edu/cmap/fr/page-daccueil) at Institut Polytechnique de Paris (IPP).

I built and taught Deep Learning at [IPP](https://m2dsupsdlclass.github.io/lectures-labs) and other institutions from 2016 to 2022.

I do scientific popularization for various NGOs and data science for [Surfrider](https://surfrider.eu/nos-missions/dechets-aquatiques/plastic-origins-70172.html).
